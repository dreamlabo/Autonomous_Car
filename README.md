# Autonomous_Car
Autonomous car I designed and coded using a Mega 2560 r3 microcontroller and C++.  

Various components implemented beyond object avoidance include: 
* An onboard music player using a microSD with a PAM8302 Class D amplifier powering a 4-ohm, 3-watt speaker. 
* A photoresistor to read the ambient light which controls the driving lights. 
* A thermistor to read the ambient temperature.
* An LCD screen to display the temperature reading, in either Fahrenheit or Celsius. 

The project was awarded third place.
